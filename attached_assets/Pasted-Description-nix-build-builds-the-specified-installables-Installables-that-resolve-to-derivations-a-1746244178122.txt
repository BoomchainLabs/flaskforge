Description

nix build builds the specified installables. Installables that resolve to derivations are built (or substituted if possible). Store path installables are substituted.

Unless --no-link is specified, after a successful build, it creates symlinks to the store paths of the installables. These symlinks have the prefix ./result by default; this can be overridden using the --out-link option. Each symlink has a suffix -<N>-<outname>, where N is the index of the installable (with the left-most installable having index 0), and outname is the symbolic derivation output name (e.g. bin, dev or lib). -<N> is omitted if N = 0, and -<outname> is omitted if outname = out (denoting the default output).

Options

--dry-run

Show what this command would do without doing it.

--json

Produce output in JSON format, suitable for consumption by another program.

--no-link

Do not create symlinks to the build results.

--out-link / -o path

Use path as prefix for the symlinks to the build results. It defaults to result.

--print-out-paths

Print the resulting output paths

--profile path

The profile to operate on.

--rebuild

Rebuild an already built package and compare the result to the existing store paths.

--stdin

Read installables from the standard input. No default installable applied.

Common evaluation options

--arg name expr

Pass the value expr as the argument name to Nix functions.

--arg-from-file name path

Pass the contents of file path as the argument name to Nix functions.

--arg-from-stdin name

Pass the contents of stdin as the argument name to Nix functions.

--argstr name string

Pass the string string as the argument name to Nix functions.

--debugger

Start an interactive environment if evaluation fails.

--eval-store store-url

The URL of the Nix store to use for evaluation, i.e. to store derivations (.drv files) and inputs referenced by them.

--impure

Allow access to mutable paths and repositories.

--include / -I path

Add path to search path entries used to resolve lookup paths

This option may be given multiple times.

Paths added through -I take precedence over the nix-path configuration setting and the NIX_PATH environment variable.

--override-flake original-ref resolved-ref

Override the flake registries, redirecting original-ref to resolved-ref.

Common flake-related options

--commit-lock-file

Commit changes to the flake's lock file.

--inputs-from flake-url

Use the inputs of the specified flake as registry entries.

--no-registries

Don't allow lookups in the flake registries.

DEPRECATED

Use --no-use-registries instead.

--no-update-lock-file

Do not allow any updates to the flake's lock file.

--no-write-lock-file

Do not write the flake's newly generated lock file.

--output-lock-file flake-lock-path

Write the given lock file instead of flake.lock within the top-level flake.

--override-input input-path flake-url

Override a specific flake input (e.g. dwarffs/nixpkgs). This implies --no-write-lock-file.

--recreate-lock-file

Recreate the flake's lock file from scratch.

DEPRECATED

Use nix flake update instead.

--reference-lock-file flake-lock-path

Read the given lock file instead of flake.lock within the top-level flake.

--update-input input-path

Update a specific flake input (ignoring its previous entry in the lock file).

DEPRECATED

Use nix flake update instead.

Logging-related options

--debug

Set the logging verbosity level to 'debug'.

--log-format format

Set the format of log output; one of raw, internal-json, bar or bar-with-logs.

--print-build-logs / -L

Print full build logs on standard error.

--quiet

Decrease the logging verbosity level.

--verbose / -v

Increase the logging verbosity level.

Miscellaneous global options

--help

Show usage information.

--offline

Disable substituters and consider all previously downloaded files up-to-date.

--option name value

Set the Nix configuration setting name to value (overriding nix.conf).

--refresh

Consider all previously downloaded files out-of-date.

--repair

During evaluation, rewrite missing or corrupted files in the Nix store. During building, rebuild missing or corrupted store paths.

--version
